# Digital-Tusbah📿
A digital tusbah project using a little technologies and logics of js

I built a Digital Tasbih using HTML, CSS, and JS. 📿✨ This modern prayer bead counter is  little user-friendly and responsive, allowing for easy dhikr (remembrance) with interactive buttons to count and reset. Accessible on any device for convenient use anywhere, anytime. 📱🙏
